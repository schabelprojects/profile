# My personal Profile Webpage for Recruiters

## Installing the Programm

I welcome you to my very first Profile Page I created specifically for Recruiters. Here is a short introduction on how you get access to the program and how to install it.

1. Clone the repository
2. In your terminal you type in ``` "npm install" ``` and all the node packages are being installed.
3. Run the program by typing the following in your terminal:
```
npm run dev
```

4. For downloading the CV you need to navigate to the server folder by typing in the following:

```cd src/server ```

and then starting the server by typing ```node index.js```

then you can click the "Download" button on the CV Page.

!!! If any complications happen feel free to write me a message !!!


Hope you enjoy!
